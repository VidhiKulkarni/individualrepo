**5.3 Notes:**

-how ppl participate in problem-solving processing (crowdsourcing)
-public data sets:
--> kaggle: vizualization, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning
         --> competitions, notebooks, etc.
         --> places to house code and manipulate it
--> google public datasets: freee for first terabyte, all in one package (Big Query and SQL)

Data.gov
--> US Govt. Data
--> agriculture, energy, water, health
Local Govt
--> keep them accountable
--> find solutions in the communisty


Distributed Computing
--> donate spare computing power to help calculations

folding@home - Stanford
--> protein folding 
--> misfolding is a problem
--> bits sent to computers that volunteer to process something and it is sent back for research

BOINC - UC Berkeley
--> variety of projects
--> math, astrophysics, minecraft
micecraft: seeds sent, seeds will develop a world, and it is sent back

sci, using citizen science, solves problems
not official scientists, but citizens, can help contribute relavent data

innovations w/ crowdsourcing:
1. spotify; collaborative playlists (many ppl part of it), or algorithm (offers new music to u based on listening activity), meta-data write-in (writing descriptions for the songs, approved by others)

2. crowdfunding; Kickstarter where ppl pitch ideas and money is given to develop the idea (Shark Tank but with millions of ppl)

IndieGoGo; philanthropic/nonprofit programs

3. Blockchain; cryptocurrency, secures concert tickets for example, through decentralized computer network

crowdsourcing: information taken from a lot of people, business, social causes with funding

**5.4 Notes:**

Netflix:


* Explicit Data:
* Thumbs
* Name, address, etc.
* Implicit Data
* When you watched
* What you binged
* Style


* Bias:
* Netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most
* Subscriptions
* Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.


* Hypothetical Loan Company:
* Creating software to assist loan officers
* Find trends in successful loans


* Reject those that donâ€™t fit trends:
* Age
* Gender
* Race
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.

* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.


* All software is biased:
* Casual vs Sweaty
* Youtube Kids
* Facebook/Insta
* Wechat
