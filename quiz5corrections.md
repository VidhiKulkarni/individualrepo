The loop should iterate once for each multiple of 5 from start to end. The number of multiples of 5 from start to end is given by Open parenthesis, open parenthesis, end minus start, close parenthesis, divided by 5, close parenthesis, plus 1. For the example given, Open parenthesis, open parenthesis, end minus start, close parenthesis, divided by 5, close parenthesis, plus 1evaluates to 4.

 The "B" code segment moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right three times so that the robot faces the top of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares to the gray square.

Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid.

The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.

Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time.

The code segment will iterate over myList from right to left, removing each element that is equal in value to the element immediately preceding it. For this list, the code segment will remove the sixth element (10), the fourth element (20), and the second element (10). This results in the list [10, 20, 10], which still contains duplicates.

The program traverses wordList starting at the end of the list and moving to the start of the list, removing any elements that are equal to "the" or "a" along the way. Inserting this statement between lines 7 and 8 decrements index after checking each list element, ensuring that all elements are checked.

The game piece begins at the rightmost black space. The piece moves one space to the left to a yellow space, and the counter is incremented to 1. The piece then moves three spaces to the left to another yellow space, and the counter is incremented to 2. The piece then moves three spaces to the left to a green space, and the counter is incremented to 3. The piece then moves two spaces to the right to the red space, and the counter is incremented to 4. The algorithm terminates now that the piece is in the red space.

This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.

When the code segment is executed, the condition ((exam > 90) AND (presentation > 80)) in the first IF statement will be false. The condition ((exam > 80) OR (presentation > 75)) in the second IF statement will also be false, resulting in the ELSE block being executed. The condition ((exam > 70) OR (presentation > 60)) in the IF statement will be true, resulting in assigning a value of "C" to variable grade and completing the execution of the code segment.
