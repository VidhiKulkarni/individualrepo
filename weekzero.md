# WEEK ZERO
TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.5
Notes:

Learning objectives
Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns
Essential knowledge
Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator or an organization
Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use
Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property
The use of material created by someone other than you should always be cited
Creative commons, open source, and open access have enable board access to digital information
As with any technology or medium, using computing to harm individuals or groups of people raises legal and ethical concerns
Intellectual property
= a work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights
Copyright
Copyright protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them your permission
Plagiarism: presenting material as your own
Legal ways to use material created by someone else
Creative Commons
Open source
Open access
Creative Commons
Creative commons provides free licenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creations
Clearly tells others what they can and cannot do with your IP
Open source and open access
Open source: programs made freely available for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified
Open access: online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
Digital divide
Unequal distribution of access to technology
GitHub Page Actions

When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
The MIT license is short, easy to understand, and allows anyone to do anything as long as I keep a copy of the license. For MIT, I will also be able to change the license in the future as my goals changed.
Apache 2.0 suits those who want their project to appeal to companies since it will display all the contributors to the project.
Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
I picked the MIT license for both my personal project and Team project. I picked the MIT license because it is recommended for a blank repository. It’s short, very easy to understand, and allows anyone to do anything so long as they keep a copy of the license, including my copyright notice. Because I’ll be able to release the project under a different license if you ever need to, I can still change the license later. This allowed me a greater flexibility.
TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.6
Learning objectives
Describe the risks to privacy from collecting and storing personal data on a computer system
Essential knowledge
Information placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that may have a harmful impact
PII can be used to stalk or steal the identity of a person or to aid in the planning of other criminal acts
Personally identifiable information (PII)
Social security number
Age
Race
Phone number
Date of birth
Email address
Mailing address
Medical information
Credit card information
Can be used by people to steal someone’s identity, bank funds, or to impersonate someone in order to gain access to an organization
PII
Search engines matina a history of what you search
Your search history is used to suggest other websites you may like or for targeted marketing
Your location can even be collect
PII: good and bad
PII can be used to enhance a user’s online experience
PII can be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored
Information placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that may have a harmful impact
Risks to privacy
The information placed online is difficult to delete
Information posted to social media can be used by others and combined with other sources to deduce private information about you
This information can then be used in ways that were not intended anime have a harmful impact
Authentication
Measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access
Authentication measures
Strong passwords
Multi-factor authentication
Strong passwords
10+ characters
Must contain a symbol
Must contain a number
Must contain lowercase and uppercase letters
Multi Factor authentication
Types of authentication
What you know
What you have
What you are
Virus and Malware
Virus: malicious programs that can copy themselves and gain access to systems that they are not supposed to be allowed in
Malware: often intended to damage a computing system or take partial control over its operation
Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attaching itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment
Encryption and Decryption
Once legitimate access to a system is gained, it is important to ensure data sent to and from the system remains uncompromised
Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access
Decryption: the process of decoding data
Two types of encryption
Symmetric encryption
Asymmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption: one key used to both encrypt and decrypt data
Example: caesar cipher
Github Page Actions

Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
On the GitHub pages, we have included our personal information of our email. In the CRUD database, we included our members’ names and our favorite food. Furthermore, in the about me pages done in tri 1 and tri 2, we had put information and links to our instagram accounts.
What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
I feel like sometimes the exposure of PII is sometimes important. For example, it is important to expose some PII on websites such as LinkedIn since the goal is to let recruiters know you. However, sometimes the exposure of PII on social media may allow others to locate you and can be potentially dangerous.
Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
A good password is one that includes upper and lower cases and include special characnters such as question marks or hashtags. A bad password is one that is too easy to remember, such as 12345 or the name of the user. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is sending verification code to the number every time the user tries to log in.
Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
Symmetrica encruption is when one key us used to both encrypt and decrypt data. On the other hand, encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding data.
Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
The deployer has to log in to their account before they can republish the website and access the website.
Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
I have had little experience with a phishing scheme since I rarely click on links sent to me. However, my dad had once recevied a text message saying that his card made an unauthorized change and that he needs to click on the link to check it out. After he clicked it, they got his card information. Some other phising techniques include sending Emails and ask you to fill it out with your personal infomration.

## 5.4 Notes:

Netflix:


* Explicit Data:
* Thumbs
* Name, address, etc.
* Implicit Data
* When you watched
* What you binged
* Style


* Bias:
* Netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most
* Subscriptions
* Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.


* Hypothetical Loan Company:
* Creating software to assist loan officers
* Find trends in successful loans


* Reject those that don’t fit trends:
* Age
* Gender
* Race
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.

* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.


* All software is biased:
* Casual vs Sweaty
* Youtube Kids
* Facebook/Insta
* Wechat

## 5.4 Questions
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
A crowdsource we can initiate is a discussion board, where people can contribute ideas and add to comments and discussions.

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
Our final project could be better with crowdsourcing because we can involve more opinions from peers about the club.


## 5.3 Notes:

-how ppl participate in problem-solving processing (crowdsourcing)
-public data sets:
--> kaggle: vizualization, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning
         --> competitions, notebooks, etc.
         --> places to house code and manipulate it
--> google public datasets: freee for first terabyte, all in one package (Big Query and SQL)

Data.gov
--> US Govt. Data
--> agriculture, energy, water, health
Local Govt
--> keep them accountable
--> find solutions in the communisty


Distributed Computing
--> donate spare computing power to help calculations

folding@home - Stanford
--> protein folding 
--> misfolding is a problem
--> bits sent to computers that volunteer to process something and it is sent back for research

BOINC - UC Berkeley
--> variety of projects
--> math, astrophysics, minecraft
micecraft: seeds sent, seeds will develop a world, and it is sent back

sci, using citizen science, solves problems
not official scientists, but citizens, can help contribute relavent data

innovations w/ crowdsourcing:
1. spotify; collaborative playlists (many ppl part of it), or algorithm (offers new music to u based on listening activity), meta-data write-in (writing descriptions for the songs, approved by others)

2. crowdfunding; Kickstarter where ppl pitch ideas and money is given to develop the idea (Shark Tank but with millions of ppl)

IndieGoGo; philanthropic/nonprofit programs

3. Blockchain; cryptocurrency, secures concert tickets for example, through decentralized computer network

crowdsourcing: information taken from a lot of people, business, social causes with funding


## 5.3 Questions

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
No, the owner does not think this was intentional.

If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
The owner doesn't think this was intentional because the owner doesn't seem upset about it.

How do you think this happened?
This happened because there was not a variety of people used for testing.

Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
This is harmful because certain races are not taken into account.

Should it be corrected?
It should be corrected because it is impacting the people that use the computer.

What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
There should be a variety of races tested on.



## 5.2 Questions
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

You can empower yourself in the digital world by automating many everyday tasks. Being technologically competent can also provide an avenue to academic and career success.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Something I can do at DNHS is help other students learn more about technology. We can empower those that are not empowered by incorporating more technology into classrooms.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

I do not believe that paper or red tape blocks digital empowerment. There is not much you can do to block content from the internet. There are such barriers at DNHS in the sense that there are websites blocked. This can also occur in other schools.

## 5.2 Notes
* Issues that contribute to divide
* Internet access varies bw all areas
* Divide → differing access
* Socioeconomic: how much money comes into house each yr
* Geographic: live  w not that many ppl; no Internet
* Demographics (Age, Religion) → less likely to have these things
* Countries: computers not common in rural areas, small # of websites, internet to protect/advocate govt, high surveillance to protect govt.
* Digital divide affects grps, individuals, raises issues, affected by actions of orgs, individuals, etc.

## 5.1 Questions
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.

Three benefits of computing are that we are able to connect with one another more quickly, we have access to a lot of information, and we can use computing to go places faster and with ease. Three harmful effects are that computing may cause dopamine issues, may be addictive, and may cause eye strain and other physical issues.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Dopamine issues occur when people get short-term dopamine from things like likes on social media posts, playing video games, etc. These issues impact my personal study because they may be addictive and cause me to lose focus.

## 5.1 Notes
* WII and iPhone
* WII before iPhone
* Both have accelerometers, in development for same periods of time
* Accelerometer part of automotive industry → airbags when too fast; prevents injury
* Quadcopter: brain w a sense, accelerometer
* Ppl complete tasks by changing things through innovation
* Miltirotor
* Benefits: deliveries, finding ppl, easy photography
* Harmful: flying in unreg. zones, illegal/dangerous, privacy concerns
* WII
* Controller: gets ppl active
* Harmful: broken tv’s, injuries
* Not every effect of innovation anticipated
* Effects of comp innovation are dangerous/beneficial at the same time, to many ppl or same person even
* Ppl create computing innovations (3d printers)
* Advances in computing generated creativity in other fields
* LOOK AT FLOWCHARTS! Assume anything will work unless stated otherwise
* Beneficial and Harmful Effects.2
* Comp innovation can impact beyond purpose
* Ex: internet was beneficial, now ppl spend more time on internet than sleep
* Dopamine feedback loops → like, comment, etc: happier
* Leads to sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity
* Tiktok PSA lol!
* Computing innovations used in ways that are unintended; programmers try to consider these ways and potential benefits/harms
* Microtransactions
* Little payments for cosmetics, paywall to functionality, sometimes pay to win, etc.
* Comp innovations may harm society, economy, culture
* Impossible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation is used
* Rapid sharing of a program results in impacts beyond intended purpose/control
