## 5.1 Questions
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.

Three benefits of computing are that we are able to connect with one another more quickly, we have access to a lot of information, and we can use computing to go places faster and with ease. Three harmful effects are that computing may cause dopamine issues, may be addictive, and may cause eye strain and other physical issues.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Dopamine issues occur when people get short-term dopamine from things like likes on social media posts, playing video games, etc. These issues impact my personal study because they may be addictive and cause me to lose focus.

## 5.2 Questions
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

You can empower yourself in the digital world by automating many everyday tasks. Being technologically competent can also provide an avenue to academic and career success.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Something I can do at DNHS is help other students learn more about technology. We can empower those that are not empowered by incorporating more technology into classrooms.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

I do not believe that paper or red tape blocks digital empowerment. There is not much you can do to block content from the internet. There are such barriers at DNHS in the sense that there are websites blocked. This can also occur in other schools.
