## TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.5
1. The MIT license is short, easy to understand, and allows anyone to do anything as long as I keep a copy of the license. For MIT, I will also be able to change the license in the future as my goals changed.
Apache 2.0 suits those who want their project to appeal to companies since it will display all the contributors to the project.

2. I picked the MIT license for both my personal project and Team project. I picked the MIT license because it is recommended for a blank repository. It’s short, very easy to understand, and allows anyone to do anything so long as they keep a copy of the license, including my copyright notice. Because I’ll be able to release the project under a different license if you ever need to, I can still change the license later. This allowed me a greater flexibility.

## TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.6
1. On the GitHub pages, we have included our personal information of our email. In the CRUD database, we included our members’ names and our favorite food. Furthermore, in the about me pages done in tri 1 and tri 2, we had put information and links to our instagram accounts.

2. I feel like sometimes the exposure of PII is sometimes important. For example, it is important to expose some PII on websites such as LinkedIn since the goal is to let recruiters know you. However, sometimes the exposure of PII on social media may allow others to locate you and can be potentially dangerous.

3. A good password is one that includes upper and lower cases and include special characnters such as question marks or hashtags. A bad password is one that is too easy to remember, such as 12345 or the name of the user. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is sending verification code to the number every time the user tries to log in.

4. Symmetrica encruption is when one key us used to both encrypt and decrypt data. On the other hand, encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding data.

5. The deployer has to log in to their account before they can republish the website and access the website.

6. I have had little experience with a phishing scheme since I rarely click on links sent to me. However, my dad had once recevied a text message saying that his card made an unauthorized change and that he needs to click on the link to check it out. After he clicked it, they got his card information. Some other phising techniques include sending Emails and ask you to fill it out with your personal infomration.

## 5.4 Notes:

Netflix:


* Explicit Data:
* Thumbs
* Name, address, etc.
* Implicit Data
* When you watched
* What you binged
* Style


* Bias:
* Netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most
* Subscriptions
* Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.


* Hypothetical Loan Company:
* Creating software to assist loan officers
* Find trends in successful loans


* Reject those that don’t fit trends:
* Age
* Gender
* Race
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.

* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.


* All software is biased:
* Casual vs Sweaty
* Youtube Kids
* Facebook/Insta
* Wechat

## 5.4 Questions
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
A crowdsource we can initiate is a discussion board, where people can contribute ideas and add to comments and discussions.

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
Our final project could be better with crowdsourcing because we can involve more opinions from peers about the club.


## 5.3 Notes:

-how ppl participate in problem-solving processing (crowdsourcing)
-public data sets:
--> kaggle: vizualization, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning
         --> competitions, notebooks, etc.
         --> places to house code and manipulate it
--> google public datasets: freee for first terabyte, all in one package (Big Query and SQL)

Data.gov
--> US Govt. Data
--> agriculture, energy, water, health
Local Govt
--> keep them accountable
--> find solutions in the communisty


Distributed Computing
--> donate spare computing power to help calculations

folding@home - Stanford
--> protein folding 
--> misfolding is a problem
--> bits sent to computers that volunteer to process something and it is sent back for research

BOINC - UC Berkeley
--> variety of projects
--> math, astrophysics, minecraft
micecraft: seeds sent, seeds will develop a world, and it is sent back

sci, using citizen science, solves problems
not official scientists, but citizens, can help contribute relavent data

innovations w/ crowdsourcing:
1. spotify; collaborative playlists (many ppl part of it), or algorithm (offers new music to u based on listening activity), meta-data write-in (writing descriptions for the songs, approved by others)

2. crowdfunding; Kickstarter where ppl pitch ideas and money is given to develop the idea (Shark Tank but with millions of ppl)

IndieGoGo; philanthropic/nonprofit programs

3. Blockchain; cryptocurrency, secures concert tickets for example, through decentralized computer network

crowdsourcing: information taken from a lot of people, business, social causes with funding


## 5.3 Questions

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
No, the owner does not think this was intentional.

If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
The owner doesn't think this was intentional because the owner doesn't seem upset about it.

How do you think this happened?
This happened because there was not a variety of people used for testing.

Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
This is harmful because certain races are not taken into account.

Should it be corrected?
It should be corrected because it is impacting the people that use the computer.

What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
There should be a variety of races tested on.



## 5.2 Questions
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

You can empower yourself in the digital world by automating many everyday tasks. Being technologically competent can also provide an avenue to academic and career success.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Something I can do at DNHS is help other students learn more about technology. We can empower those that are not empowered by incorporating more technology into classrooms.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

I do not believe that paper or red tape blocks digital empowerment. There is not much you can do to block content from the internet. There are such barriers at DNHS in the sense that there are websites blocked. This can also occur in other schools.

## 5.2 Notes
* Issues that contribute to divide
* Internet access varies bw all areas
* Divide → differing access
* Socioeconomic: how much money comes into house each yr
* Geographic: live  w not that many ppl; no Internet
* Demographics (Age, Religion) → less likely to have these things
* Countries: computers not common in rural areas, small # of websites, internet to protect/advocate govt, high surveillance to protect govt.
* Digital divide affects grps, individuals, raises issues, affected by actions of orgs, individuals, etc.

## 5.1 Questions
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.

Three benefits of computing are that we are able to connect with one another more quickly, we have access to a lot of information, and we can use computing to go places faster and with ease. Three harmful effects are that computing may cause dopamine issues, may be addictive, and may cause eye strain and other physical issues.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Dopamine issues occur when people get short-term dopamine from things like likes on social media posts, playing video games, etc. These issues impact my personal study because they may be addictive and cause me to lose focus.

## 5.1 Notes
* WII and iPhone
* WII before iPhone
* Both have accelerometers, in development for same periods of time
* Accelerometer part of automotive industry → airbags when too fast; prevents injury
* Quadcopter: brain w a sense, accelerometer
* Ppl complete tasks by changing things through innovation
* Miltirotor
* Benefits: deliveries, finding ppl, easy photography
* Harmful: flying in unreg. zones, illegal/dangerous, privacy concerns
* WII
* Controller: gets ppl active
* Harmful: broken tv’s, injuries
* Not every effect of innovation anticipated
* Effects of comp innovation are dangerous/beneficial at the same time, to many ppl or same person even
* Ppl create computing innovations (3d printers)
* Advances in computing generated creativity in other fields
* LOOK AT FLOWCHARTS! Assume anything will work unless stated otherwise
* Beneficial and Harmful Effects.2
* Comp innovation can impact beyond purpose
* Ex: internet was beneficial, now ppl spend more time on internet than sleep
* Dopamine feedback loops → like, comment, etc: happier
* Leads to sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity
* Tiktok PSA lol!
* Computing innovations used in ways that are unintended; programmers try to consider these ways and potential benefits/harms
* Microtransactions
* Little payments for cosmetics, paywall to functionality, sometimes pay to win, etc.
* Comp innovations may harm society, economy, culture
* Impossible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation is used
* Rapid sharing of a program results in impacts beyond intended purpose/control
